This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Goal is to create a full-stack application using a repository to customize itself.

## Principles and pillars

The pillars of this project are:

- [x] [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for boilerplate and standard folder structure
- [x] yarn instead of npm for: ~/.yarn-cache
- [x] [React](https://reactjs.org/) and React DOM (using hooks only) to reduce code base
- [x] React router to interact with single page application
- [x] [Material.io](https://material-components.github.io/material-components-web-catalog/#/) for laziness to create a GUI myself and consistent look
- [x] create views and [router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic)
- [x] ability to navigate to different views
- [x] [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)
- [x] add [sass](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet)
- [x] add [material-ui example](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/docs/src/pages/getting-started/page-layout-examples/dashboard)

## Todo (different repo)

- [ ] integrate a back-end
- [ ] integrate proxy to allow back-end calls
- [ ] create repo back-end using json-like db (jsend)
